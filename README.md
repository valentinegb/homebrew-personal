# valentinegb Personal

Tap for miscellaneous formulas and casks which I need that either aren't allowed in official taps or are part of unmaintained taps

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install valentinegb/personal/<formula>`

Or `brew tap valentinegb/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

> [!TIP]
> Use `curl -sL URL | shasum -a 256` (replacing `URL` with the download url of
> the new version of a formula/cask) to easily get the `sha256`.
