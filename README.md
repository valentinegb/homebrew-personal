# Valentinegb Personal

A tap for miscellaneous formulas and casks which I need that either aren't allowed in `homebrew/core` or `homebrew/cask` or are part of other taps which are unmaintained.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install valentinegb/personal/<formula>`

Or `brew tap valentinegb/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
