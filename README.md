# valentinegb Personal

Tap for miscellaneous formulas and casks which I need that either aren't allowed in official taps or are part of unmaintained taps

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install valentinegb/personal/<formula>`

Or `brew tap valentinegb/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "valentinegb/personal"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
